# Pandas Introduction Tutorial

## Summary of steps to complete

- [x] Fork this repository so you have your own copy to work on.
- [x] Clone the repository on your local machine. 
- [ ] Open the repository Jupyter Notebook in VSCode or Jupyter Notebooks.
- [ ] Run the code shown in this video to your Jupyter Notebook.
- [ ] Push your updated file to your GitHub repository.
- [ ] Answer assignment questions and submit a link to this GitHub repository in Canvas.

## Fork & Clone this repository

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerGitPractice
* This can also be done directly in VSCode
  * Create a new folder on your machine where you want to put this repository if you don't already have one you want to use.
  * Copy the Clone or Download path for this repository from GitHub.
  * In VSCode from the command pallette (Ctrl-Shift-P) run Git: Clone
  * Paste the path into the path field which pops up
  * Select your new folder you created on your machine
  * A new folder for the repository with the repository files should be in the folder you selected showing in the Explorer window in VSCode on the left side.

## Open the repository Jupyter Notebook
* Open Jupyter Notebook on your machine.
* In the Files tab you should see folders that match the folders on your machine (i.e. Desktop, Documents, Downloads). Navigate to your repository folder by clicking on the folder links. Open the .ipynb file in your repository by clicking on it.
* When your repository workbook opens in your browser window, make sure you're using your assignment workbook with the new environment by going to Kernel - change kernel - select Basics
* Jupyter Notebooks can also be run in VSCode. Once you click on the file in VSCode, it takes a minute to start up. Once it starts you can create cells and run code. (The interface is a little different, though.)


## Follow along with this tutorial

* Complete the tutorial at: https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/python-pandas-tutorial-complete-introduction-for-beginners/
  * The presenter made the tutorial he created in a Jupyter Notebook and the files he uses in the tutorial available on GitHub. Forking that repository directly includes several other tutorials as well. I have downloaded the folder just for this tutorial here so you don't need to get the files from his repository.
  * Note that the presenter uses a technique to install Python packages from within Jupyter notebook which I understand to be problematic sometimes. I would not recommend following that practice unless you understand the complexities involved. I would stick to installing packages using Conda from the command line. However, should you wish to learn more, I found an article which you can read. https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/12/05/installing-python-packages-from-jupyter/
  * You can open the Jupyter Notebook file and run each code block as you go through the tutorial. You can follow along with the online version to see if your result match what he has online.
  
## Push your updated file to your GitHub repository

* This can be done in VSCode.
  * In VSCode click on the Source Control button.
  * You should see the files that had changes. (Mine has the original file which shows an M next to it and a new file which says checkpoint in the name. You really only need to push the original file, but if you push both it shouldn't hurt anything.)
  * Hover over the changed file. Click the + sign to stage the change.
  * Enter a commit message in the message field and click the checkmark to commit the change.
  * Click on the 3 dots for more actions and select Sync. This will push the updated file to your GitHub repository.
  * Submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas.
